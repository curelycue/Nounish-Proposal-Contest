# Nounish Proposal Contest - “is your idea nounish enough?”



Introduction: 

An alternative proposal system. Though experimental, it could bring about the boost in creativity the DAO thirsts for.

The Nounish Proposal Contest is a competition for the most nounish idea. It is coupled with an airdrop acting as a filtration system and a trustless mechanism for bootstrapping new instances. 

We’re aiming to improve the ability of non-owners to be part of our narrative and further our perception of what DAOs could be.

The premise is extremely straight-forward. A multi-sig is created and funds representing the reward are forwarded to it. Each Noun owner automatically recives a number of tokens(conveniently called NPC tokens). Each one of the tokens representing an opportunity to participate in the competition. All ideas will be collected on Snapshot and will be voted on by Nouns, bringing forth the winner and rewarding the most nounish idea of them all.
